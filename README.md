# NBA-Player-Performance-Prediction

Being the most popular and widely known sport, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has
fans across the globe. Audience around the world view the sport and enjoy it. Each and every
person has their own favorite player. People are excited to watch their favorite player game and
cheer him. As well as people are very curious towards the player's performance and how is going
to perform in the upcoming matches. Predicting the results of games and players performance is
an common application of machine learning.


The NBA has freely accessible data for forecasting. Because the performance of players in
different positions can be quantified using the same set of statistics, it is particularly well suited
for machine learning applications. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms are being used to
predict individual player performance. The goal is to predict the performance of individual
players in terms of efficiency. There are various factors that effects the player’s performance in
many ways. It depends on How many minutes the player is in the court, how many goals the
player has made, number of fouls and turn overs committed and so on. All these statistics plays
an crucial role in deciding the player’s efficiency. In simple terms, the efficiency is nothing but
the difference between positive accomplishments of a player and negative accomplishments of a
player. There are many machine learning algorithms available which are going to be
implemented to make the predictions.
